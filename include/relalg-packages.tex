% Using the forest package, there is a known issue that edges sometimes cut through child nodes.
% See the package documentation on CTAN (https://www.ctan.org/pkg/forest), section 6.2. "Known bugs", "Edges cutting through sibling nodes":
% While it would be possible to fix the situation after child alignment (at least for some child alignment methods), I have decided against that, since the distances between siblings would soon become too large. [...] The bottomline is, please use manual adjustment to fix such situations.
